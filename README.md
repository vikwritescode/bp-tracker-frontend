# BP Tracker Frontend

## What is this repo?
This is the frontend code for my BP debate tracker, built with react and vite. This fetches and generates records using an API, and interfaces with firebase to provide signin functionality. 

The theming has been done with shadcn and tailwind. 

This, at the moment, also allows for records to be made through simply a URL and a name, instead of adding the results of all of the rounds manually. 

## Features
- Import from URL
- Get position wide averages
- View Debates Individually
- Sign Up and Login

## Coming Soon
- Add Individual Records
- Delete Records
- Display Average and Standard Deviation of Speaks
