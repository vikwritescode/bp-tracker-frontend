## Setup

Create a new project on Firebase, adding authentication and a web app from the overview screen. Add a .env file to the repo's root folder, with VITE_FIREBASE_{API_KEY, AUTH_DOMAIN, PROJECT_ID, STORAGE_BUCKET, MESSAGING_SENDER_ID, APP_ID}; for each, copy the value of the corresponding entry in the firebaseConfig object of the web app you've created, visible from your Firebase project settings.

Finally, add VITE_API_URL to your .env, pointing towards the address of your backend API instance. The frontend can then be launched using `npm run dev` from its root folder.
