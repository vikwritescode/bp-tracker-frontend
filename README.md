# Derivative 
An Open Source BP Debate Tracker

## What is this repo?
This is the frontend code for my BP debate tracker, built with react and vite. This fetches and generates records using an API, and interfaces with firebase to provide signin functionality. 

The theming has been done with shadcn and tailwind. 

This, at the moment, also allows for records to be made through simply a URL and a name, instead of adding the results of all of the rounds manually.
